              It's never been easier to find a coach to help you advance your
              career, take control of your finances, overcome your limiting
              beliefs, or find love.
            </p>
            <p class="strong">
              Unfortunately, it's never been easier to
              <span class="emphasis">become</span>
              a coach, too.
            </p>
            <p>
              The truth is Coaching is a largely unregulated industry. That
              means
              <a

              and charge clients whatever they want for their services.
            </p>
            <p>
              All too often, that ends up being a substantial amount of money,
              especially for recently divorced women!
            </p>
          </div>

        <section class="gray_card" id="mixed_feelings_card">
          <div class="gray_card--text_block">
            <p>
              I've been a full-time Coach since 1995 and watched the rise of the
              Coaching industry with mixed feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the one hand, I think a new helping profession is a welcome
              development: the more people we have out there working to improve
              people's lives the better.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, I know from personal experience that
              unscrupulous and inexperienced coaches have damaged Coaching's
              reputation and credibility in the eyes of many people.
            </p>
            <p>
              From time to time, I see that damage reflected in the eyes of the
              people I meet when I tell them I'm a Dating & Relationship Coach,
              and it breaks my heart!
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why I've devoted a section of Compatible Connection's
              website to educating potential clients, divorce professionals, and
              other visitors about my credentials.
            </p>
            <p>
              There <span class="emphasis">are</span> good coaches out there,
              and I like to think I'm one of them, but I understand, for better
              or worse, the burden is on me to assure people I'm worthy of their
              time, trust, and attention.

              There's no quick and easy answer to this question...but there
              <span class="emphasis">are</span> things women can do to maximize
              their chances of working with a qualified coach.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first thing you absolutely need to do before hiring a coach
              is<span class="strong"> research their credentials.</span>

              Getting your MCC is not something you can do over the course of a

              Coach U is one of the Coaching industry's founding organizations.

            <p>
              They've been developing certification standards and training
              accredited coaches since the early '90s. In fact, Coach U has been
              around so long that several Coach U graduates launched the ICF in
              1994!
            </p>

            <p>
              I received my Certified Coach credential from Coach U in 1998.
              What I learned through Coach U has been invaluable to my Coaching
              practice. Not only did Coach U provide me with a strong foundation
              for my client work, it also provided me with a wealth of licensed
              coaching tools & methodologies (such as their Tru Values Program)
              I've customized to meet the needs of women dating after divorce.
            </p>

            <p>
              Coach U's standards for awarding their Certified Coach credential
              are just as rigorous as the ICF's standards for awarding their MCC
              credential.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to qualify for a Certified Coach credential, Coaches must
              first:

            <p>
              It may feel a bit strange or uncomfortable to approach a total
              stranger, but don't worry! Any reputable coach will always welcome
              the opportunity to speak with prospective clients and answer their
              questions. Results-driven coaching is about building a
              transformative relationship with your clients. That's almost
              impossible to do if a coach and a client aren't a good fit
              for each other.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you've never worked with a Coach before, you may not know what
              questions to ask during your interview. Here are some basic "must
              ask" questions to help you get the most out of your conversation
