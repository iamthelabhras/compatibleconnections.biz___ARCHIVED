                    If, like me, you were raised on '60s TV shows like
                    <span class="emphasis">Father Knows Best</span>,
                    <span class="emphasis">Donna Reed</span>, and
                    <span class="emphasis">Dennis the Menace</span>, you
                    probably came to believe that every little girls' dream was
                    to grow up, marry their knight in shining armor, start a
                    family, get a dog, and live happily after.

                  <p>I know I definitely did!</p>
                  <p>
                    By the time I was in my early 20s, I was married. By the
                    time I was in my late 20s, I'd left the workforce and thrown
                    myself entirely into raising my two small children.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Being a mother was everything I expected, nothing like I
                    expected, and so much more! The love I felt towards my
                    children was indescribable, but, as the years began to roll
                    by, I began to feel something else. I began to feel the need
                    to do and be more than "just" a stay-at-home Mom.

                    I didn't know what this "something more" could be at first.
                    But one day, purely by chance, I picked up a magazine at

                    This was a lot of work! Coaching was in its infancy back
                    then: this long before anyone with a website (and a
                    weekend’s worth of “training”) could claim to be a Coach.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I was still spending my days at home with my family but, at
                    night, I was busy helping other families create long-term,
                    loving relationships with their children.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I taught parenting classes and lead workshops on positive
                    discipline and redirecting children's behavior; I partnered
                    with local hospitals and other child advocates to promote
                    parent education; and I wrote and published my first book,

                  <p>
                    Best of all, I also launched my first business: a coaching

                    And then, one day, after 24-years of marriage, I found
                    myself thrust into the middle of a high conflict divorce.
                    There was someone else. My white picket fence had termites!
                    My little girl's dream was crushed.

                  <p>
                    My divorce dragged on for two-and-a-half years. It was one
                    of the most difficult periods of my life but, thankfully, I
                    emerged on the other side of divorce with my confidence, my
                    pride, and my optimism intact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I still believed in true love, but I knew, if I was going to
                    find it, I'd have to radically rethink everything I thought
                    I knew about love, romance, and relationships.

                  <p>
                    I decided to see life after divorce as a tale of epic
                    adventure and discovery!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Although I hadn't been on a date in decades, I didn't view
                    my newly single status as something to be afraid or ashamed
                    of. I saw it was an opportunity to throw out my old beliefs
                    about relationships, develop new approaches to meeting and
                    partnering with men, and discover what real love meant for
                    me!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Perhaps more importantly, being newly single also gave me an
                    opportunity to rediscover the parts of myself I'd lost touch
                    with after two decades of being a wife and a mother.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    These were tall tasks, but I had the support of wonderful
                    friends and colleagues. I also had the enormous advantage of
                    almost two decades' worth of training and experience as a
                    Coach. I decided to use that training and experience to help
                    me systematically tackle the challenges of dating after
                    divorce.

                    I won't lie: it wasn't easy...especially at first. There
                    were plenty of missteps and plenty of blind alleys.

                  <p>And, of course, there were plenty of bad dates!</p>

                  <p>
                    I saw it all. Men who ended up being much older than they
                    looked in their profile pictures. Creepy guys who came on
                    way too strong with “seductive” one-liners. Scam artists
                    that preyed on vulnerable and lonely divorcees. From time to
                    time, I entertained doubts about being (or wanting to be)
                    married again. What a frustrating process!

                  <p>
                    Through it all, though, I managed to hold onto my sense of
                    optimism. I knew that I deserved true love. I kept learning
                    and I kept moving forward.

                    Relatively early on, I realized part of the problem was
                    that, as a teenager, I'd been trained to date randomly.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I had unconsciously acquired the belief that dating was
                    essentially a numbers game with few real rules, apart from
                    "look good" and "attract as many men as possible." Up until
                    that point, I'd implicitly assumed dating was more about
                    being lucky than being smart: all you could do was simply
                    put yourself out there and hoped for the best. Vague
                    criteria (like "chemistry") was all you had to zero-in on
                    potential mates. And even if relationship after relationship
                    lead to dead-ends and heartbreak, you just had to keep
                    dating and eventually you'd find "the One."
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    None of this made any sense! No wonder so many of our first
                    marriages end in divorce!

                  <p>
                    The answer seemed obvious: deliberate dating. I needed to
                    identify what specific traits I was looking for in a
                    partner, and I needed to link every stage of the dating
                    process to "screening" for those traits.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This was a huge breakthrough, but it also raised some big
                    questions.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    What specific traits was I looking for in a man? And how
                    could I know, with some degree of certainty, that a man
                    actually had those traits?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I'd learned the hard way that many older men in the dating
                    pool weren't always honest. And, more to the point, asking
                    men to fill out a questionnaire or grilling them on a first
                    date was a surefire way to send them running!

                    For the second time since my divorce, I was feeling

                    I discovered that compatibility, not chemistry or physical
                    attraction, was the crucial factor driving long-term
                    relationship success. I came to understand that identifying
                    the traits I was looking for in a compatible partner was
                    inseparable from the process of "partnering with myself
                    first," a phrase I coined to describe the sometimes
                    difficult but always rewarding task of discovering my core
                    needs and values. I realized that I could use much of the
                    small talk and game-playing that surrounded online dating to
                    my advantage by asking men simple, open-ended questions
                    about themselves and their lives to discreetly assess their
                    compatibility. (I also realized that by making these
                    "connecting questions'' fun, light, and flirty, I could
                    easily avoid making every date feel like a joyless test or
                    job interview.) I belatedly grasped the fact that
                    relationships are built, not discovered, and that the skills
                    I needed to date deliberately were the same skills I needed
                    to find and keep true love.

                    Armed with this newfound understanding, I re-entered the
                    online dating scene.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    There were still missteps, but consistently applying my
                    insights into deliberate dating and compatibility gave me a
                    sense of control, purpose, and perspective I'd never
                    experienced before as a single.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Dating was no longer the anxiety-producing chore it once
                    was. Red flags were easier to spot. I didn't have to wait
                    until a face-to-face meeting to get a general idea of
                    whether or not a man was a good match. I came to genuinely
                    enjoy connecting with men on and offline, even the guys I
                    knew weren't a good fit romantically. (It turns out there
                    are actually a lot of good guys out there, if you know how
                    to find them.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dating stopped feeling like a gauntlet I had to run as
                    quickly as possible. I was able to slow down and really
                    appreciate my search for a compatible connection.

                    the man who would eventually become my second husband, and
                    made the transition from single woman to committed partner.

                    As my relationship with Stu deepened, I made the decision to
                    launch a new Coaching firm, Compatible Connections, to help
                    other divorced women skip right to the good parts of dating
                    after divorce, without having to go through all the trouble,
                    frustration, and heartache I did.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    At the heart of my new business were two Signature Series -
                    <a href="" target="_blank">Partner With Yourself First</a>
                    and
                    <a href="" target="_blank">Seek, Sort, & Select</a>
                    <span class="strong">Your Compatible Partner Online</span>

                    - that organized and collected the insights and techniques
                    I’d developed over the course of my journey from befuddled
                    divorcee to deliberate dater to happily remarried.

                    Since founding Compatible Connections, I've acquired almost
                    a decade's worth of experience showing single women how to
                    find the love of their lives after divorce.

                  <p>
                    I've worked with hundreds of clients whose stories reminded
                    me so much of my own, and it's been my privilege to help
                    them re-discover the joys of dating and coupling.
                  </p>

                  <p></p>

                  <p>
                    I get up everyday eager to help another single woman write
                    her happy ending. And I'm grateful for everything I've
                    learned, and continue to learn, in the process.

                  If, like me, you were raised on '60s TV shows like

                  <span class="emphasis">Donna Reed</span>, and
                  <span class="emphasis">Dennis the Menace</span>, you probably
                  came to believe that every little girls' dream was to grow up,
                  marry their knight in shining armor, start a family, get a
                  dog, and live happily after.

                <p>
                  By the time I was in my early 20s, I was married. By the time
                  I was in my late 20s, I'd left the workforce and thrown myself
                  entirely into raising my two small children.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Being a mother was everything I expected, nothing like I
                  expected, and so much more! The love I felt towards my
                  children was indescribable, but, as the years began to roll
                  by, I began to feel something else. I began to feel the need
                  to do and be more than "just" a stay-at-home Mom.

                  This was a lot of work! Coaching was in its infancy back then:
                  this long before anyone with a website (and a weekend’s worth
                  of “training”) could claim to be a Coach.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I was still spending my days at home with my family but, at
                  night, I was busy helping other families create long-term,
                  loving relationships with their children.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I taught parenting classes and lead workshops on positive
                  discipline and redirecting children's behavior; I partnered
                  with local hospitals and other child advocates to promote
                  parent education; and I wrote and published my first book,
                  <span class="emphasis">101 Parenting Recipes</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Best of all, I also launched my first business: a coaching
                  firm for parents.

                  And then, one day, after 24-years of marriage, I found myself
                  thrust into the middle of a high conflict divorce. There was
                  someone else. My white picket fence had termites! My little
                  girl's dream was crushed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My divorce dragged on for two-and-a-half years. It was one of
                  the most difficult periods of my life but, thankfully, I
                  emerged on the other side of divorce with my confidence, my
                  pride, and my optimism intact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I still believed in true love, but I knew, if I was going to
                  find it, I'd have to radically rethink everything I thought I
                  knew about love, romance, and relationships.

                  I decided to see life after divorce as a tale of epic
                  adventure and discovery!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Although I hadn't been on a date in decades, I didn't view my
                  newly single status as something to be afraid or ashamed of. I
                  saw it was an opportunity to throw out my old beliefs about
                  relationships, develop new approaches to meeting and
                  partnering with men, and discover what real love meant for me!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Perhaps more importantly, being newly single also gave me an
                  opportunity to rediscover the parts of myself I'd lost touch
                  with after two decades of being a wife and a mother.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These were tall tasks, but I had the support of wonderful
                  friends and colleagues. I also had the enormous advantage of
                  almost two decades' worth of training and experience as a
                  Coach. I decided to use that training and experience to help
                  me systematically tackle the challenges of dating after
                  divorce.

                  I won't lie: it wasn't easy...especially at first. There were
                  plenty of missteps and plenty of blind alleys.
                </p>
                <p>And, of course, there were plenty of bad dates!</p>

                <p>
                  I saw it all. Men who ended up being much older than they
                  looked in their profile pictures. Creepy guys who came on way
                  too strong with “seductive” one-liners. Scam artists that
                  preyed on vulnerable and lonely divorcees. From time to time,
                  I entertained doubts about being (or wanting to be) married
                  again. What a frustrating process!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Through it all, though, I managed to hold onto my sense of
                  optimism. I knew that I deserved true love. I kept learning
                  and I kept moving forward.

                  Relatively early on, I realized part of the problem was that,
                  as a teenager, I'd been trained to date randomly.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I had unconsciously acquired the belief that dating was
                  essentially a numbers game with few real rules, apart from
                  "look good" and "attract as many men as possible." Up until
                  that point, I'd implicitly assumed dating was more about being
                  lucky than being smart: all you could do was simply put
                  yourself out there and hoped for the best. Vague criteria
                  (like "chemistry") was all you had to zero-in on potential
                  mates. And even if relationship after relationship lead to
                  dead-ends and heartbreak, you just had to keep dating and
                  eventually you'd find "the One."
                </p>

                <p>
                  None of this made any sense! No wonder so many of our first
                  marriages end in divorce!

                <p>If random dating was the problem, what was the solution?</p>

                <p>
                  The answer seemed obvious: deliberate dating. I needed to
                  identify what specific traits I was looking for in a partner,
                  and I needed to link every stage of the dating process to
                  "screening" for those traits.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This was a huge breakthrough, but it also raised some big
                  questions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  What specific traits was I looking for in a man? And how could
                  I know, with some degree of certainty, that a man actually had
                  those traits?
                </p>

                <p>
                  I'd learned the hard way that many older men in the dating
                  pool weren't always honest. And, more to the point, asking men
                  to fill out a questionnaire or grilling them on a first date
                  was a surefire way to send them running!

                  For the second time since my divorce, I was feeling confused,
                  discouraged, and overwhelmed as a later-in-life single.

                  I read book after book on relationships, dating, and romance;
                  I reached out to fellow Coaches with my questions and asked
                  them for feedback and recommendations; I talked to other
                  single divorcees.

                  I learned to distinguish the work of

                  the work of grifters & New Age gurus who offered single women
                  plenty in the way of general advice but very little in the way
                  of practical techniques or real results.

                <p>
                  I gave myself permission to worry less about finding someone

                  My patience paid off and, eventually, my downtime and hard
                  work lead me to another huge breakthrough!
                </p>

                <p>
                  I discovered that compatibility, not chemistry or physical
                  attraction, was the crucial factor driving long-term
                  relationship success. I came to understand that identifying
                  the traits I was looking for in a compatible partner was
                  inseparable from the process of "partnering with myself
                  first," a phrase I coined to describe the sometimes difficult
                  but always rewarding task of discovering my core needs and
                  values. I realized that I could use much of the small talk and
                  game-playing that surrounded online dating to my advantage by
                  asking men simple, open-ended questions about themselves and
                  their lives to discreetly assess their compatibility. (I also
                  realized that by making these "connecting questions'' fun,
                  light, and flirty, I could easily avoid making every date feel
                  like a joyless test or job interview.) I belatedly grasped the
                  fact that relationships are built, not discovered, and that
                  the skills I needed to date deliberately were the same skills
                  I needed to find and keep true love.

                  Armed with this newfound understanding, I re-entered the
                  online dating scene.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There were still missteps, but consistently applying my
                  insights into deliberate dating and compatibility gave me a
                  sense of control, purpose, and perspective I'd never
                  experienced before as a single.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Dating was no longer the anxiety-producing chore it once was.
                  Red flags were easier to spot. I didn't have to wait until a
                  face-to-face meeting to get a general idea of whether or not a
                  man was a good match. I came to genuinely enjoy connecting
                  with men on and offline, even the guys I knew weren't a good
                  fits romantically. (It turns out there are actually a lot of
                  good guys out there, if you know how to find them.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dating stopped feeling like a gauntlet I had to run as quickly
                  as possible. I was able to slow down and really appreciate my
                  search for a compatible connection.

                  As my relationship with Stu deepened, I made the decision to
                  launch a new Coaching firm, Compatible Connections, to help
                  other divorced women skip right to the good parts of dating
                  after divorce, without having to go through all the trouble,
                  frustration, and heartache I did.

                  and

                  <span class="strong">Your Compatible Partner Online</span>

                  - that organized and collected the insights and techniques I’d
                  developed over the course of my journey from befuddled
                  divorcee to deliberate dater to happily remarried.
