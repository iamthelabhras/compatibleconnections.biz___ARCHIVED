                Now that the Fourth of July has come and gone, it's officially
                the height of summer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The nights are balmy and long, the weekends are sun-drenched and
                lazy. It’s the perfect time to switch on your dating radar and
                get into a meet-cute mindset.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to make the most of your summer, you’ve got to make
                time to get out of the house and talk to new people!
              </p>

              <p>
                This might sound easy, but sometimes it can be a struggle to
                break out of our usual routines. I know from personal experience
                that thinking up new places to go can be challenging. Ditto for
                figuring out what to say to a man you've just met.
              </p>

              <p>
                Thankfully you’re a Meet-Cute subscriber. You don’t have to
                tackle these challenges on your own!
              </p>
              <p>
                Below you’ll find a list of fun summer activities that are also
                great ways to meet men. You'll also find some simple Connecting
                Questions you can use to strike up a conversation with anyone
                you might meet while you’re out soaking up the sun and having a
                blast.

              <p>
                For whatever reason, craft breweries are a magnet for single
                men.
              </p>
              <p>
                The craft beer industry has made huge inroads in the U.S. over
                the past few years, which means that a simple Google search
                should turn up at least one or two breweries in your area. If
                that's not the case, dip into your local pubs' online profiles
                and websites. Odds are at least one of them has a seasonal beer
                menu, special happy hours, or a microbrew on tap.
              </p>

              <p>
                Call up a girlfriend (or two) and make plans to check a nearby
                brewery or pub the middle of the afternoon. Grab a seat at the
                bar try chatting with your fellow beer drinkers. Start things
                off with this great ice-breaker: “It’s my first time here. Do
                you have a favorite beer I should try?”

                Summer is event season! It’s basically one giant singles mixer.
              </p>
              <p>
                No matter where you live, I guarantee there is some sort of
                “fest” coming up that caters to one of your interests. Food,
                music, sporting events, movies … if you can think of it, there’s
                probably a summer event dedicated to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gather a few adventurous friends, buy tickets, and get ready to
                scope out the scene. Talk to the people around you in line. Ask
                a cute guy what he’s going to order at a particular food truck.
                Ask another cute guy to hold your drink for a second while you
                tie your shoe: just be sure to introduce yourself when you say
                thanks!

                Schedule a local(ish) trip with friends over a hot summer
                weekend. Book a couple of nights in a town or resort, preferably
                one that advertises tons of activities. Try and find a place
                that has cute little restaurants, a lake (or a river or a
                shoreline), hiking trails, and fun divey bars.
              </p>

              <p>
                Be sure everyone has a chance to break away from the group when
                you’re out: most men won’t walk up to a table of girlfriends. If
                you spot a cute guy, get a conversation going with a simple
                “Hi,” then follow it up with something like, “So, do you have
                anything fun planned for the rest of the summer?”
              </p>

              <p>
                Don’t worry if you feel nervous approaching someone your own.
                Men love it when women take initiative. It’s a major perk of the
                modern dating world!

                Last, but certainly not least, you should seriously consider

                When I was a new divorcee, I took a chance and enrolled in group
                golf lessons on a whim. It was by far one of the best decisions
                I made post-divorce.
              </p>

              <p>
                Learning to golf allowed me to make new friends, pick up a sport
                I could play well into my old age, take in some beautiful
                scenery, and practice mindfulness. It also gave me a great
                excuse to visit the “19th hole” after a lesson!

                Avid golfers like to hit the driving range on their way home
                from work and on the weekends. Buy a bucket of balls, grab a
                club from the pro shop, and work on your swing. You don't have
                to be great golfer. Plenty of the men on the range will be happy
                to coach you!

                Summer is a great time to be single, and now you have no excuse

                There are almost as many answers here as there are single women!
                Some singles take their cue from Sex and the City's Charlotte
                York and say three dates is the absolute minimum. Other women I
                know insist that anything less than five dates is a recipe for
                disaster. Most women, though, seem baffled. They really don’t
                know what to do. They feel like they're walking blindfolded
                through a minefield.
              </p>
              <p>
                The decision to have (or not to have) sex with your partner is a
                deeply personal one, and, like most deeply personal questions,
                this one doesn't lend itself to any one-size-fits-all answers.
                That said, there are general principles every woman can use to
                guide their decision-making.

                Enter comedian Steve Harvey. My personal take on sex and dating
                owes a great deal to Harvey's surprise best-seller Act Like a
                Lady, Think Like a Man. Admittedly, Harvey's book generated a
                bit of controversy when it first came out. Some women thanked
                him for his insights into the male psyche, while others felt he
                pandered to outdated gender roles. My feeling, though, is that
                the book's central message - that women approach sex cautiously
                and only consider sleeping with a man when they're sure he wants
                a meaningful relationship - will always ring true for divorced
                or widowed women of a certain age.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why? Because middle-aged women who suddenly find themselves
                single, sometimes after decades of marriage, are far more likely
                than other singles to be targeted by scammers and pick-up
                artists.

                Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to suggest that danger and
                heartbreak lurk behind every flirty wink, first date, or text
                message. Years of working with single women have convinced me
                there are plenty of great guys out there. Unfortunately, they've
                also convinced me there are men on every dating site who will
                try to take advantage of my clients’ vulnerability, loneliness,
                and general cluelessness.

              <p class="center strong" id="dating_deep_dive_bottom">
                How do you tell the good guys from the bad ones?
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s surprisingly simple. And here's where those general
                principles I was talking about earlier come into play.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, before you even start looking for a date, get clear -
                really clear - about what you want out of your life after
                divorce or loss. Articulate what’s important to you: your core
                needs and values, your relationship deal breakers, and your
                ideal partner's characteristics. Then make sure every new
                relationship, every budding romance - no matter how promising,
                no matter how exciting - goes through a probationary period of
                some kind before you even consider having sex.
              </p>
              <p>
                You don’t need to explicitly spell this out, although you’ll
                want to tell your partner you’d like to take things slow so you
                both can get to know each other. However you decide to frame it,
                don't focus on how long this getting-to-know-you process takes.
                Time isn't the single most important thing to consider here.
                Compatibility is.
              </p>
              <!-- Blockquote / break-out text in e-mailed Meet-Cute. -->
              <p>
                Compatibility is like a suit of armor that protects you from the
                worst aspects of dating. Once you know what you're doing, it's
                impossible to form a genuinely compatible connection with a man
                who's out to take advantage of you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Master the art of using compatibility to seek, sort, and select
                potential partners, and you'll eliminate 99% of pick-up artists
                and scammers from your dating pool before you leave the house
                for your first date. And if by some miracle one of these sleaze
                bags manages to get past your screening process, you're still
                covered. A few simple questions and you'll know you need to
                steer clear.
              </p>
              <p>
                Few scammers and pick-up artists are able to deceive a woman who
                knows who she is and knows what she wants. Fewer still are able
                to penetrate the defenses of a woman who understands why
                randomly dating different guys is the worst way to find true
                love or discover who is now that she's single for the first time
                in years. The dating world's bad apples get what they want,
                quickly and efficiently, by exploiting newly single women's
                uncertainties and insecurities. Confident and conscious daters
                who make compatibility a priority - and pre-requisite for sex -
                don't make good targets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although a lot of what I've outlined here is simple, that
                doesn't mean compatibility itself is easy. The truth is that it
                can be surprisingly difficult to put these principles into
                practice on your own. That's why I've been able to build an
                entire business around teaching women the art of making
                compatible connections.

                  Flexting refers to the practice of bragging, name dropping, or
                  exaggerating online in order to impress someone before an
                  offline meeting. Flexting is surprisingly common. According to
                  the dating site Plenty of Fish, 47% of single people have
                  experienced flexting in the past year. Unsurprisingly, though,
                  women are usually on the receiving end of all this hot air:
                  Plenty of Fish also reported that 63% of the women they
                  surveyed received flexts, as compared to just 38% of the men.

                <p>
                  Micro-cheating is a form of infidelity that stops short
                  physically cheating on someone, but still calls a partner's
                  commitment and integrity into question. (Some dating coaches,
                  myself included, would refer to this as emotional infidelity.)
                  Microcheating men typically engage in a range of unsavory
                  behaviors, including contacting exes on social media, lying
                  about their relationship status online, keeping (or utilizing)
                  an active dating profile, using fake names to hide other women
                  in their smartphone contacts, sending other women cutesy or
                  sexually charged texts & emojis, or aggressively flirting with
                  other women in public. If any items in this list remind you of
                  someone you're dating, run!

                  Apps might give you access to hundreds of eligible men, but,
                  without a clear sense of who you are and what you're looking
                  for in a partner, you'll struggle to form a meaningful
                  connection offline.

                  Of course, there's always the chance some tech visionary will
                  come along and completely change the way we think about online
                  dating.

                  This article does a great job pointing out how traditional
                  approaches to dating are fraught with frustrating
                  contradictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Women are taught that love conquers all, but we're all also
                  taught to seek out men who are superficially attractive or
                  wealthy. We're told to follow our hearts, but we're also
                  warned about the dangers of not using our heads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Megan's article shows us how cultivating emotional
                  intelligence can help us sidestep these contradictions and
                  strike the right balance between logic and passion.
