                You may think having a partner to share the New Year with is all
                you need to be happy, but being in a relationship isn’t easy. It
                requires a lot of work, healthy compromises, and understanding
                differences without judgment.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may think your coupled friends are super-duper happy. After
                all, that’s certainly the impression they give at social
                gatherings, on Facebook, or in those holiday cards they send out
                every year that tell you all about their amazing job, their
                amazing vacations, and their amazing life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Relationship experts, however, are quick to warn us that happy
                couples are almost never as happy as they seem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is the grass always greener? I know from personal experience,
                and from working with my clients, the answer most of the time is
                no. How many women really know how to be great pickers the first
                time around? Not many! The truth is most of us get fooled.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you find yourself wishing you had a “plus one” on your arm
                this year, stop and remember that being single frees you to live
                authentically. You don’t have to fake your way through another
                holiday, family gathering, or work-related event, straining to
                keep a smile on your face while secretly wishing you could leave
                a miserable relationship behind you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, singles may feel lonely sometimes, but true loneliness is
                feeling alone in a marriage. Be grateful that your occasional
                feelings of loneliness stem from actually being alone, not from
                being stuck in the wrong relationship!
              </p>
              <p>
                So many men and women settle, whether they fully realize it or
                not. They marry the wrong person because it seemed like the next
                logical step. Or because their biological clock was ticking. Or
                because everyone expected them to propose, so they did. Or
                because they were worried no one else would come along. And
                while it’s true that couples can (sometimes) make a mediocre
                marriage work, in the end do these lucky few ever feel like
                they’re truly loved? Probably not.
              </p>
              <p>
                Great gifts are worth waiting for – being cherished by a man who
                says "I can't believe I met you!" is something you truly
                deserve. Remember that as you head into the New Year. And, as
                always, if there's anything I can do for you, please let me
                know!

                <p>
                  The opposite of love isn't hate; it's indifference. Ghosting,
                  for those of you who have yet to experience is what happens
                  when someone you believe cares about you, whether it be a
                  friend or someone you're dating, disappears without any
                  explanation. no phone calls or emails, not even a text.
                  Ghosting isn't new - people have long done disappearing acts -
                  but years ago this kind of behavior was limited to a certain
                  type of scoundrel. In today's dating culture, though, ghosting
                  is an increasingly widespread phenomenon.

                <p>
                  Ah, breadcrumbing! The coward's way out of what is already a
                  coward's way out. Unlike ghosters who cease all communication
                  completely, breadcrumbers will send flirtatious but
                  non-commital texts - like "Hey, what's up?" - without ever
                  making an effort to meet up. Breadcrumbing can go on for
                  months, even years. For the breadcrumber, this behavior is an
                  "easy" way for them to keep one foot in your life in case they
                  decide they want to pursue something further on down the line.
                  (More alarmingly, breadcrumbing can also be used to make you
                  so desperate you'll jump at the chance to spend time with
                  someone ... on their terms of course.) Sometimes, the
                  breadcrumber will disappear for weeks, only to resurface and
                  throw a few more crumbs your way, leaving you to tear your
                  hair out, wondering whether or not they're interested in you
                  at all.

                <p>
                  This is one of the newer, and more terrible, modern dating
                  trends. When someone is orbiting you, they'll outwardly be
                  ghosting you but continue to closely follow you on social
                  media. (You won't know this is happening on Facebook or
                  Twitter, but Instagram Stories and Snapchat will tell you who
                  has watched your content.) More often than not, if someone you
                  thought was ghosting you suddenly reappears, they've been
                  orbiting you the whole time. People's motivations for orbiting
                  can vary, but this kind of behavior is especially popular with
                  men who don't want to fully commit but also want to hedge
                  their bets. Avoid orbiters at all costs! As the saying goes,
                  if someone doesn't want you at your worst, then they don't
                  deserve you at your best!

                Whether it’s a blind date or a too-good-to-be-true listing on
                Craigslist, we’ve all experienced trepidation when giving our
                number to a total stranger. Burner handles this conundrum with
                grace and style, putting multiple short-term phone numbers at
                your disposal for any occasion, each of which can be nuked with
                the tap of a button. Signup is quick and painless, although you
                are required to share your real iPhone number with the
                developer, which then becomes your account number.

                  Burner phones (or numbers) used to be associated with
                  espionage and other shady dealings, but today the technology
                  behind them is quickly becoming a necessary feature of online
                  dating.

                  they feel it takes all the magic and romance out of falling in
