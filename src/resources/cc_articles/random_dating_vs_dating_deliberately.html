            <p>
              I don’t know what you were streaming after your divorce, but I
              binge-watched HBO’s Sex and the City. The show’s iconic main
              characters - Carrie Bradshaw, Samantha Jones, Charlotte York, and
              Miranda Hobbes - were exactly who I needed to keep me company as I
              tried to wrap my head around being single after twenty-five years
              of marriage.
            </p>

            <p>
              All four single ladies were successful, good-looking, full of
              life, and independent; and yet, in spite of everything they had
              going for them, they still struggled to find love. It was so
              relatable! Charlotte, the show’s resident idealist and romantic,
              said it best:
            </p>

            <p class="center strong">
              “I’ve been dating since I was 15. I’m exhausted. Where is he?”
            </p>

            <p>
              I found myself asking similar questions when I began dating after
              divorce. Like my “friends” on Sex and the City, my experiences in
              the dating pool, especially at first, were comedic...and far from
              encouraging! I think we’ve all been there: the creeper who looks
              at you like a door prize; the guy who inexplicably “ghosts” you
              after a few dates, then lazily attempts to reconnect weeks or
              months later; the “slow fader” who can’t just come out and say
              he’s not interested; the “recently separated” guy who is, in fact,
              still very much married. I didn’t think dating in mid-life would
              be easy, but did it really have to be this hard? It seemed like my
              search for love was nothing but an endless stream of obstacles and
              disappointments.

            <h2>What is Random Dating?</h2>
            <p>
              Eventually, I realized the problem was that, as a teenager, I'd
              been trained to date randomly. I’d unconsciously acquired the
              belief dating was essentially a numbers game with few real rules,
              apart from “look good” and “attract as many men as possible.” I'd
              implicitly assumed dating was more about being lucky than being
              smart: all you could do was put yourself out there and hope for
              the best. Vague criteria (like "chemistry") was all I had to zero
              in on potential mates, and, even if relationship after
              relationship lead to dead-ends and heartbreak, the solution was to
              just keep dating until I found “the One”.
            </p>

            <p>
              None of this made any sense! An entire generation of women were
              raised to date with no definite plan, purpose, or destination. No
              wonder so many of our first marriages ended in heartbreak! And no
              wonder so many of us were finding it hard to start dating again
              after divorce.
            </p>

            <h2>What is Deliberate Dating?</h2>
            <p>
              If random dating was the problem, what was the solution? The
              answer seemed obvious: deliberate dating. I needed to identify
              what specific traits I was looking for in a partner, and I needed
              to link every stage of the dating process to "screening" for those
              traits.
            </p>

            <p>
              This was a huge breakthrough, but it also raised some big
              questions like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="strong">
                What specific traits was I looking for in a man?
              </li>
              <li class="strong">
                How could I know, with some degree of certainty, that a man
                <span class="emphasis">actually</span> had those traits?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I'd learned the hard way that many older men in the dating pool
              weren't always honest; and, more to the point, asking men to fill
              out a questionnaire or grilling them on a first date was a
              surefire way to send them running!
            </p>

            <p>
              I started looking for answers to my questions. I read book after
              book on relationships, dating, and romance; I reached out to
              fellow Coaches with my questions and asked them for feedback and
              recommendations; I talked to other single divorcees. I learned to
              distinguish the work of real relationship experts from the work of
              grifters and New Age gurus who offered single women plenty in the
              way of general, one-size-fits-all advice but very little in the
              way of practical techniques, personalized feedback, or real
              results. I gave myself permission to worry less about finding
              someone and worry more about finding myself. I took up golfing. I
              reconnected with my love of dancing. I kept growing as a person.
            </p>
            <p>
              My downtime and hard work eventually lead me to another huge
              breakthrough:
            </p>

            <p class="center strong">
              I discovered that compatibility, not chemistry or physical
              attraction, was the crucial factor driving long-term relationship
              success!
            </p>

            <p>
              I came to understand the traits I was looking for in a man were
              inseparably linked to my own unique character traits, and that if
              I wanted to recognize my ideal partner when I saw him, I’d have to
              partner with myself first. I realized I could use the small talk
              and game playing surrounding online dating to my advantage by
              asking men simple, open-ended questions about themselves and their
              lives to discreetly assess their compatibility. (I also realized
              that, by making these connecting questions fun, light, and flirty,
              I could easily avoid making every conversation or date feel like a
              joyless test or high stakes job interview!) I belatedly grasped
              the fact that relationships are built, not discovered, and that
              the skills I needed to date deliberately were the same skills I
              needed to find and keep true love.
            </p>

            <p>
              Armed with this newfound understanding, I re-entered the online
              dating scene. Applying my insights into deliberate dating and
              compatibility gave me a sense of control, purpose, and perspective
              I'd never experienced before as a single. Dating was no longer the
              anxiety-producing chore it once was. Red flags were easier to
              spot. I didn't have to wait until a face-to-face meeting to get a
              general idea of whether or not a man was a good match. I came to
              genuinely enjoy connecting with men on and offline, even when the
              guys I met weren't a good fit romantically. (It turns out there
              are actually a lot of good guys out there; if you know how to spot
              them!) Dating stopped feeling like a gauntlet I had to run as
              quickly as possible. After years of discouragement, I was finally
              able to slow down and really appreciate my search for a compatible
              connection.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <h2 id="random_dating_sub_heading">
              If You Don’t Know What You’re Looking For, You’ll Never Find It!”
            </h2>
            <p>
              So many things separate random daters from deliberate daters, but
              perhaps the biggest single difference is deliberate daters
              understand the importance of compatibility.
            </p>

            <p>
              Compatibility is like the glue that holds a relationship together.
              Compatible partners share similar lifestyle choices, interests,
              core beliefs, and, most importantly, core values. They use
              compatibility to build a strong foundation for their relationship,
              a foundation that leads to a deepening sense of intimacy over
              time. This foundation also nurtures a deeper sense of security and
              togetherness than most random daters ever experience, even in
              their most “successful” relationships. Why? Because compatibility
              starts with a conscious understanding of what makes a relationship
              work and builds on it. It doesn’t resist change; in fact, it
              allows for and encourages personal growth in both partners. It
              relishes the passing of time. It sidesteps the problems associated
              with “settling” and minimizes the likelihood of nasty,
              late-in-the-game surprises or dealbreakers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Does compatibility mean different things for different people? Of
              course! But all deliberate daters know what compatibility means
              for them. And that means they know what they’re looking for in a
              partner long before they hop on the Internet or sit down for a
              first date.
            </p>
            <p>
              As cliche as it sounds, if you don’t know what you’re looking for,
              you’re never going to find it! Whether you’re recently divorced
              and still working up the confidence to “get back out there” or
              you’re a fabulous single actively searching for love, do yourself
              a favor and learn to date deliberately. I promise you: it’s the
              best way to create the life you desire and find the love you
              deserve!
